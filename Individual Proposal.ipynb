    "# Gender Identity vs. Height Dissatisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "- Is there a significant difference in height dissatisfaction among individuals of different gender identities?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- **Independent Variable: Gender Identity (`DEMO_gender`)**\n",
    "  - In this case, \"Presented but no response\" can not be taken into account. Also, the sample amounts of \"Non-binary\" are too small to analyze. Let's just take the **variable \"gender identity\" only to be \"Men\" or \"Women\"**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Dependent Vriable: Height Dissatisfaction (`PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_height_dissatisfaction_score`)**\n",
    "  - This variable is a bunch of numbers. We can calculate its statistics.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *To visualize we can draw **histogram, box plot and violin plot** for it.*\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Why choose these plot?**\n",
    "   - **Box Plots**: Show spread and central tendency, highlighting median, interquartile range (IQR), and outliers to facilitate direct gender comparison.\n",
    "   - **Violin Plots**: Reveal distribution shapes within each gender, helping to identify patterns like bimodal distributions that may not appear in box plots.\n",
    "   - **Histograms**: Present the overall frequency distribution of dissatisfaction scores, offering insight into general trends.\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Analysis and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "   - Ensure there are no invalid or missing entries in the two key columns. If there are, handle missing values by either dropping them or using imputation methods if appropriate.\n",
    "   - Check for outliers in height dissatisfaction scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Exploration\n",
    "   - Calculate summary statistics for height dissatisfaction scores within each gender identity category.\n",
    "   - Visualize the data distribution, using:\n",
    "     - **Box plots or violin plots** to show score distributions across genders.\n",
    "     - **Histograms** to inspect overall dissatisfaction score patterns.\n",
    "     \n",
    "      **Assumptions for Visualizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Visualizations like box plots and histograms assume that the data is **representative** of the populations they intend to describe.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Height dissatisfaction scores should be on a **comparable scale** across all groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **t-tests:** for binary analysis\n",
    "   \n",
    "     **Assumptions for t-tests**\n",
    "   \n",
    "     - The dissatisfaction scores within each gender identity group should ideally follow a **normal distribution**.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - The variance in dissatisfaction scores should be roughly equal across gender identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Observations within each group (gender identity) must be **independent** of each other.\n",
    "     \n",
    "## Hypothesis and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant difference in height dissatisfaction scores among different gender identities.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Height dissatisfaction scores vary significantly across gender identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Results\n",
    "- **Rejecting the Null Hypothesis (Support for H₁):** If analysis finds statistically significant differences in height dissatisfaction scores across different gender identities, it would reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that certain gender identities report higher or lower levels of height dissatisfaction.\n",
    "- **Failing to Reject the Null Hypothesis (Support for H₀):** If analysis shows no statistically significant differences in height dissatisfaction scores among gender identities, it would fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that height dissatisfaction is relatively uniform across different gender identities."

    "   - **Handle Missing Values**: Check each trait and age column for missing values and decide whether to remove or impute them.\n",
    "   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for each Big Five trait to get a sense of the typical scores.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - **Line Chart**: Plot a line chart with age and five traits.\n",
    "   \n",
    "     **Assumptions for Visualization (Line Chart)**\n",
    "   - **Comparable Trait Scores**: The scores should be on a consistent scale across all age groups to make visual comparisons meaningful.\n",

    "   - **Regression Analysis**: Run a linear regression analysis for each trait with age as the predictor variable to assess the effect of age on each trait’s score.\n",

    "   - **Linearity:** If analyzing age and traits with linear regression, we assume a roughly linear relationship.\n",
